## Project Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## Summary of Findings

> The average duration of bike trip by minutes is around 11.24 (Min).

> The usage bikes is down in the weekend days (Sat & Sun), and coming rise up in weekdays (working days).

> The peak time start around 08:00 AM and 05:00 PM, it's make sense because most of the jobs start and end in the same time.

> The most common age is between the bike riders 30 to 42 age.

> Most of bike riders are Subscriber 'Member' with (90.5%) and the rest of bike riders are Customer with (9.5%).

> The Male gender is the most bike riders by (74.5%) and Female riders the second by (23.4%).

> The Customer bike user spend more time than Subscriber user.

> Subscriber bike users seem to have lower trips between 10 AM till 3 PM, and Customer bike users seem to have higher trips than Subscriber users during the same hours.

> The Other gender in general tend to have much longer trips, especially on the weekend (Sat & Sun) and the second is Female.

>The Other gender (Customer user type) has the highest average (26,286)mins and the lowest for Male gender (Subscriber user type) with (9.776)mins.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> There are two types of clients using bikes on daily basis (Subscriber 'Members' and Customer 'Casual' ) and the most user type is Subscriber and most of the Subscriber is Male gender with common ages between 30 to 40.

> The Peak time is in the morning between 7 Am to 8 AM and in the evening between 5 PM to 6 PM.

> The Customer user type spends more time on trips especially the Other gender unlike Subscriber user type male gender.

> The middle of week increases the demand for bike user, unlike the weekend.
